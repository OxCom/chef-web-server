==========
This soup made for [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/) and wasn't tested. So, please, be calm and remember that, this is private configuration for web servers. If you find any bug, just help me or make a fork and do your stuff.

``` wget https://www.opscode.com/chef/install.sh```

``` sudo bash install.sh ```


Start cook
========
``` sudo chef-solo -c config.rb -j config.json ```


Repository Directories
======================

This repository contains several directories, and each directory contains a README file that describes what it is for in greater detail, and how to use it for managing your systems with Chef.

* `cookbooks/` - Cookbooks with MAGIC!!!
* `data_bugs/` - Empty
* `environments/` - Store environments in .rb or .json in the repository.
